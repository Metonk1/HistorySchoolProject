//I can't forget Parent <- Group (Did that before)

//Two relationships
//Composition/Aggregation "has a" Scene has a button (Polymorphism) Scene can have a parent, and scene cna have a node.
//Inheritance "is a" Student is a person

//Scene can only have one thing, either parent or pane or node

//Interesting, if(name.getText().isEmpty()){
